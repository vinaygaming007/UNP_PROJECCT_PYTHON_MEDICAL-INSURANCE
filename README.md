#UNP Project Python Medical-Insurance

Completed this project as a part of my Python (Machine Learning) Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

OVERVIEW:- This project covers various foundational aspects of a machine learning project including data preprocessing, data visualization, and prediction using multiple models. The best-performing model was chosen for deployment

TOPICS COVERED
1. Exploring the Dataset

2. Converting Categorical Values to Numerical

3. Plotting Heatmap to See Dependency of Dependent Value on Independent Features

4. Data Visualization (Plots of Feature vs Feature)

5. Data Preparation

6. Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms (Classification)

   Logistic Regression

   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

   Decision Tree

   Random Forest

7. Plotting Graph for All Models to Compare Performance

8. Preparing Model for Deployment

9. Algorithms Comparison

10. Summary
